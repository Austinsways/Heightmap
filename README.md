# Overview

This is a random noise generator that creates data stored in a jpeg that represents terrain height, intended for use in a game engine such as unreal engine. These different jpegs can be fed into a translator that creates terrain at the height of the pixel values within the jpeg.

This will allow me to create randomly generated terrain for games and simulations with unreal engine, as well as the biome creation around them.

# Development Environment

This software was created using python 3 in visual studio code. 
It uses the PIL image library and the random library

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

# Future Work


* Create a heightmap that is 3 demensional to allow for 3D terrain generation.
* Fix the random black pixels that occasionally appear.
* Fix the occasional pixels being stuck on black.
